# BeamMP-Commandline-Map-Change-for-Linux

Command line based Map selector, Mod downloader and Auto Restart tool, and BeamNG plugin for chat based map votes.

For this Program to work the Executable needs to be in the linux sub-folder for the BeamMP server and "screen" needs to be installed on your linux server.

"./BeamMPEdit init" will automatically initialize the program and create nessecary files for the Plugin

You will also need to edit the "Launch Skript" for BeamMP called "BeamMPStart.sh", it will be automatically created in the same dictionary as the Command line tool, you will just need to change the "/BeamMP-for-your-distro-.22.04" line to the correct executable for your distro.
